Roboto v2.317
Downloaded from https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto
A newer version (v2.318) exists in https://github.com/googlefonts/roboto/releases
but there is not a hinted variant available, so that's why the files from Google Fonts
have been used.

The webfonts in ttf, woff and woff2 format have been generated using the
Fontsquirrel Webfont Generator at https://www.fontsquirrel.com/tools/webfont-generator
